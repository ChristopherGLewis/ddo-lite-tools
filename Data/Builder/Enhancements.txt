This is especially true of enemies well defended against nonmagical attacks, such as an Inevitable. This is also true at high levels, when 4 SP will do an average of 27 unstoppable damage (plus applicable spell boosts), making several casts of Nimbus of Light bursts much cheaper and more total guaranteed damage than, say, Cometfall.
