This ray has double spell range. (Activation Cost: [4/3/2] spell points. Cooldown: [12/8/4] seconds.)} }Note: This spell has no saving throw, and hits creatures with Spell Resistance every try. Coupled with its low spell point cost, long range, and relatively fast casting time, Nimbus of Light is a surprisingly effective means of damage against single, powerful enemies, such as bosses. This is especially true of enemies well defended against nonmagical attacks, such as an Inevitable. This is also true at high levels, when 4 SP will do an average of 27 unstoppable damage (plus applicable spell boosts), making several casts of Nimbus of Light bursts much cheaper and more total guaranteed damage than, say, Cometfall.

Shadowblades share some of the properties of Flame Blade: As you level up, they become more powerful. They appear in your Weapon slot; you can see their description box as with any weapon. If you unequip your Shadowblades, they will dissipate into nothingness and must be summoned again. Shadowblades are ki weapons (you stay centered).}{-Conjure Dual Shadowblades: Creates a Shadowblade in each hand.}{-Imbue with Shadow: This effect changes the Material type of your equipped weapons, shields & orbs to Force and grant them additional bonuses. This is considered an Item Enchantment. As an object made of force, it's immune to damage from oozes & rust monsters, although any special material properties of the original weapon remain.}Note: Enchanting your weapons (including the Shadowblades) in this way will not add the "magic" enchantment for the purposes of breaking DR (this also means that it will not prevent Shadowblades from bypassing DR).}Bug:  Summoned shadowblade cannot be moved from TR cache to inventory (prevents TRing!).
