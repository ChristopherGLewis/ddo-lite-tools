; See ItemChoices.txt for details on how to customize weapon lists in
; the planner. Weapon lists can include combination items, which are
; defined here.
;
; A combination item is a unique weapon name that stands in for multiple 
; weapon types. For example, light pick and heavy pick are wrapped into 
; a single combo item named "Pick."
;
; Create combination items here and point them to base items by setting 
; the Parent value. Every weapon in the game is available to use as a parent
; item, and they are defined in Items.txt.
;
; This file gets overwritten every update. To save your own customizations,
; copy this file to UserItemCombo.txt in the same folder as this file
; and make your changes there. If found, the program reads the User version
; instead of this. 
;
; An example of a customization might be to create an "Axe" item (pointing 
; to any Onehand axe) that consolidates Battle Axe, Hand Axe, and Dwarven Axe 
; into one item.
;
; Another more severe idea is to create a "Sword" item to consolidate Bastard 
; Sword, Kama, Khopesh, Kukri, Long Sword, Scimitar and Short Sword into one 
; single item. This would greatly reduce clutter in the list.
;
; You can also create a combo item as an abbreviation. For example,
; Rpt Hvy Crossbow instead of Repeating Heavy Crossbow. It's fine to create 
; a combo item as a stand-in for a single item in this way.
;
; If a combo item has the same name as a base item, or if the Parent item isn't 
; found, the combo item is ignored.
;
; Remember that the planner only recognizes 3 weapon types: Onehand, Twohand
; and Range. Combination items only exists for your edification, and as such,
; the planner doesn't care which or how many actual weapon types are represented
; by any given combination item.
